Track WooCommerce stock levels over time and measure product performance to make smarter inventory decisions.

## Description

WooCommerce SKU Performance creates a daily record of your product inventory levels using WordPress's scheduling system (WP-Cron). 

Each day, it takes a snapshot of every product's stock quantity and stores this data in a custom database entry.

After considering all the stock changes, it allows you to access the admin interface to find a performance table showing each product's SKU, total orders, days with available stock, and current inventory level. 

This lets store owners quickly identify which products sell well and which frequently run out of stock. The data helps make inventory decisions by highlighting products that might need restocking priority or those that aren't performing well.
